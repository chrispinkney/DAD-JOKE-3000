# DAD JOKE 3000

[Repl.it demo here!](https://dad-joke-3000.chrispinkney.repl.run)

A Python project that generates ~~hilarious~~ terrible, terrible dad jokes. It takes in a string and searches a dad joke filled database for jokes matching the input text.

This project taught me about basic interaction with JSON based APIs.

## Technology
DAD JOKE 3000 uses Python in conjunction with the Random library to picture a returned joke at random. It grabs the jokes through the wonderful API provided by [icanhazdadjoke](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api).
